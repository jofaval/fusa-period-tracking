A quick view into what are some of the challenges that I either will be facing or already am.

## Data storage

The main focus of this app is that it's completely locally stored, no data should fetched nor uploaded to any sort of server, so that the data is as private as possible.

But, doing that, effectively, and also securing the data locally, that will, for sure, be a challenge, because, what about cache? what if the user refresh or removes all local data, should then the app data be removed with it? And many more challenges that will rise along the way.

I've mentioned this quite a few times, but, as a cis male, I'm not experienced with the period tracking apps, nor what should be tracked or not, and how, about the period. It will be a learning process, but it is indeed something I have to learn, and want to.

This is my second Vue app/project ever, and the first completely serious one I've ever deployed. It is also the first project I've ever managed with Github Projects, coming from Trello and Jira (mostly Trello).

First time using: pinia, i18n, cypress (kind of), vite, vitest, element-plus (vue's library) and tailwind.
