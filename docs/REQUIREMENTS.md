## Data & Privacy
[↑ Table of contents](#contents)

It is really important, the most crucial feature of this project/app, the data should be as private as possible.

Security is not what I mean by privacy, for this project's intents and purposes, I understand privacy as sharing the information with as many people as possible, only whomever the user may want to.

## Features

It should provide what a normal experience for a period tracking app is, but to get to that point I'll have to make some sacrifices.

It should, at least, aspire to cover and manage the following:

- The cycle, it's length, pain levels, weight, temperature, intercourse, birth control, cervical mucus, mood, and other symptoms.
- Pill reminder to take medications, supplements, birth control pills, and injections. [WITHOUT NOTIFICATIONS ATM]
- Some sort of mood tracking, personal experience, journaling.
- The tampons used: brand, quantity, quality, price, how many were used (wether it be stored all at once or by unit of time/usage).
- Be gender neutral, customizable if possible.

As some neat features, it'd be cool if it could:

- Accurately predict your cycle, warn you beforehand.
- Genders and pronouns should be totally up to the user's preference.
- Profiles, in case you want to share the device with more people, or it is going to be shared.

## Visual Identity
[↑ Table of contents](#contents)

It's been a long time since I've done some sort of serious visual arts (attempts), but there's one clear goal:

MAKE. IT. CLEAN.

It's not going to be a stereotypical "womanly" app, it's an app for everyone, wether it be women, gender-neutral nonbinary folks, trans-men, E-VE-RY-ONE.
I'd like it to be up to the user's preference, but I'll go for a clean style as a starting point.
