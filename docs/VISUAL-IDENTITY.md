## What to expect?

This will be an incremental documentation that I, overtime, will be updating, modifying, adding to it. So... what to expect? Complete and utter chaos.

## Identity

I'd say that starting with a bland, plain and boring UI may be a great starting point, I will be looking into details and online resources for polishing the visual style.

I just simply don't want to fall under the classic pinky "femenine" look, because I'd feel it wouldn't be representative at all, if something, using the trans flag color palette. But I don't want a place where it's a direct relation to the sex/gender, I just want something that may look cool and peaceful, which is why I would imagine you'd need under those circumstances.
